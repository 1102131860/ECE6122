# ECE6122 Lab3 OpenGL with OBJ files and Multiple Objects 

## Create a dynamic 3D graphics application using lighting, shading, model transformations, and keyboard inputs. 

### Oct 22 2024
Finishes most of tasks:  
1. loaded obj and jpg  
2. put the chesses in the chessboard with scaling, transform, and rotation.  
3. used spherical coordinate system to view the objects  
4. dealed with keyboard input in the controller

But some improvement could be achieved in further
* The light toggle didn't show the expected result that only toggles off specular and diffuse components
