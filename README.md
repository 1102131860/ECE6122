# ECE6122 CUDA-based John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
## Nov 2 2024
* Finished the **Normal Memory** Transfer, but haven't test it at the Cuda GPU.  
* The next stuffs need to finish are:  
    * **Pinned memory** AND **Managed Memory** transfer at the CUDA
    * Test the running time and correctify the code (it should be time for pinned memory < time for Managed Memory < time for Normal Memory)
